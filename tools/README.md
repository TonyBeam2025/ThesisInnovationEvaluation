# Tooling Overview

Helper scripts that do not belong in the packaged module. They are grouped by
purpose:

- `analysis/` — data exploration and AI diagnostics
- `maintenance/` — refactor or migration utilities
- `verification/` — sanity checks and regression replays
- `legacy/` — archived experiments kept for reference

Run any script via `uv run python <path-to-script>` from the project root.
