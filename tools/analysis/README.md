# Analysis Scripts

This directory hosts standalone analysis helpers used to inspect thesis artifacts,
log structures, and AI extraction outputs.

## Typical tasks
- Investigate structured outputs for specific documents (`analyze_*`)
- Examine TOC, references, or section boundaries
- Produce diagnostic summaries consumed by reports under `docs/reports`

Run these scripts with `uv run python tools/analysis/<script>.py` from the project root.
